  // 1. Initialize your Gemini client here (if not already globally initialized).
  // 2. Construct a prompt for the Gemini API. The prompt should instruct the AI to:
  //    - Analyze the provided text (extractedMistakesText).
  //    - Identify specific topics or concepts where the user made errors.
  //    - Generate a set of new practice questions (e.g., 3-5 questions) that target these identified weaknesses.
  //    - Format the questions according to the `GeneratedQuestion` interface (e.g., provide text, topic, and optionally options, answer, explanation).
  //    - You might want to specify the type of questions (e.g., multiple-choice, short answer).
  // 
  //    Example Prompt Structure:
  //    `Based on the following text which describes errors made on a test: "${extractedMistakesText}"
  //     Please generate 3-5 new practice questions. For each question, identify the main topic.
  //     Return the output as a JSON array of objects, where each object has 'id', 'text', and 'topic' fields.`
  //
  // 3. Make the API call to Gemini.
  // 4. Parse the response from Gemini. Ensure it matches the `GeneratedQuestion[]` structure.
  //    You might need error handling and type checking for the API response.
